      <b>Hi! I am Stella</b>
      <br />
        I define myself as a very enthusiastic person. 
        I am passionate about everything I do.
        I am curious, and always want to learn and grow personally and professionally.
        I am proactive.
        <br />
        I like working in a team, meeting different people, learning from them, and contributing what I know. But I have no problem working alone either.
        <br />
        I have done many things throughout my life, in different areas, that arenâ€™t reflected here because it is oriented to the IT sector in which I am quite new.
        I am currently training in programming and studying English, to perfect myself...
        <br />
        <b>This is my first individual project. </b> 
        <br />
        I thank you in advance for your interest and the time you took to read this about me... have a nice day!
      </p>
